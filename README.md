# VGCC

## What/Who We Are
The VGCC is an organization dedicated to supporting the cultural field of art that is video games. We are a small group of individuals with a passion for video games and a drive to cultivate positive experiences for all members of the larger video game community. We aspire to represent fans of all types of video games in an attempt to cultivate wider understanding and representation of video games as a cultural art form.

## Mission
The mission of the VGCC is to help good developers and publishers - and others in the gaming industry - make good fun games, and to promote that work to an audience of gamers and non-gamers that might not otherwise ever see it; to help platform and support games - and the people who make them - that aren’t being platformed or supported by traditional gaming media; and to make as many games as much fun for as many people as possible.

## Goals

### To have fun.
Fun begets fun. Above all else we understand that joyless organizations have no organic
grassroots way to promote or inspire fun. We strive to demonstrate the fun that can be had with
video games by keeping this goal behind all we do.

### To broaden the idea of video games as a cultural art form
Video games are art. From the simplest small game to the most in depth narrative driven 100+
hour bestseller, games inspire us in the same ways that books or music or paintings or any
other artform does. However, video games are rarely viewed at the same level or on the same
stage. We strive to change this.

### To build community in the video game space
Video games naturally create and foster communities around games. We strive to maintain
these communities while also facilitating higher order communities which encompass more and
more parts of this space. We aim to foster the idea that all fans of video games are more similar
in that way than they are different.

### To highlight and demonstrate the positive effects of video games
Video games do great good in society. Some of this good is easy to point to - groups like
Games Done Quick have raised over 50 million dollars for charity - but much is more subtle. The
simple comfort that any of us find in a game we love, the stories games that games tell and
inspire us with, the friendships formed through shared play, and countless other simple benefits
are all positive impacts of games on society. We strive to highlight these positive effects to
audiences that may simply not see these benefits.

### To support developers and publishers making good games
It’s hard to be a modern video game developer or publisher. Like all industries, there are many
outside pressures on the industry, resources chief among them. We strive to identify, platform,
and support good developers and publishers that are making and producing good games that
help drive the broader cultural artform that is video games.

### To introduce a wider array of video games to a wider audience
If you talk to people of a certain age you can find stories of parents and grandparents who
would call every video game system, from a Sega Genesis to an XBox, a ‘Nintendo’ because
that was all they had picked up about video games. While things aren’t likely that bad any more,
there are still plenty of people who have no idea of the range and scope of what video games
exist in the world, and would likely deeply enjoy some games that they have no idea exist.

### To leave video games better than when we found them
Everyone has a first experience with a video game. Some of those may be 40 or 50 years in the
past, some of those might be last week. Our desire is to foster a mindset of positive growth in
video games not only in the purely economic sense, but in the cultural one. Video games can
always be better in some way - can tell more stories, can reach more people, can drive more
connections - and we hope to create a mentality in this space where this growth sustains well
after we’re gone.
Above is likely fairly set, below likely has some filling out to do
